# Read about reference pointers
# Finish socket class
# Finish Client and then test client with poc server

# Basically rewrite the client to mimic the poc but the commands will be in
# main, and the connection will be handled by client socket
#
# Release clients from memory on server side
# Implment generic socket recv function
# 
# debug mode
# comment all the code
# 
# output logs into files
#
# make loggers based on streams
#
# Tests:
# - Make sure that when two clients send a message at the same time, they dont
# get ignored
# - make sure that everything is being deleted correctly 
#
#
# Notes:
# I am not making any pure virtual functions and instead completely overriding
# the Socket recv and close function in ServerSocket, becuase the normal recv
# function will suffice for most types of sockets, whereas it wont for the
# ServerSocket.
#
# Questions
# ask about memory being released when client leaves
